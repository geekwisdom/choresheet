# Famliy Choresheets

> There is no daily chore so trivial that it cannot be made important by skipping it two days running. â€”Robert Brault

In our family we all take responsibility for household chores. This tool regularily prints 
a different choresheet each week, rotating the chores among famliy members


## Getting Started

Extract the github project to a location on your linux box (eg: /usr/local/scripts/autoprint)

Modify the chorelist ods (Open Office 'Calc' File). Unless perhaps your family
happens to have the same names as mine. Extract each rotating week as a 
diffeent PDF in the format of "ChoreSheet{X}.pdf" where X is 1, 2 ,3 4 etc

Schedule a cronjob on a weekly basis. Each week a new ChoreSheet{X} file is printed to your printer

use the prarameter 'reprint' to repring the last sheet manually without 
impacting the current sheet.

*Note: This script writes the last chorenum by default to your $TEMP directory.
On many linux machines this folder is erased on each reboot, so your chore
count will restart at 1 with every restart. To prevent this point the location to a different folder
